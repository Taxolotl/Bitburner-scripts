## Guide to my scripts:

  buy-server.js is the script you run when you want to buy a server.

  crimes.js is a WIP, I need BN4;

  exploits.js is only to get SF--1 (untested);

  find-coding-contract is a script that looks for coding contracts and tells you the closest one.

  find-server.js finds a specific folder that you give it via args.

  factions-toast.js makes a toast pop up whenever you can join a faction. it also tells you what you need to do for it. BN4 will improve

  go.js is the main money-earning script.
    deploys wk.js, hk.js, and gr.js to all servers with a specific target

  info.js gives information about the server given to it via args.

  lib.js is an important library script needed for a lot of the other scripts.

  myHNet.js is a script that purchases and upgrades hacknet nodes.

  restore.js is a script to make go.js work again once it stops working, however it may not work all the time, also not currently in use.

  self-hack-deploy.js deploys self-hack.js to all servers.

  thousand.js is a script you only need to run to get one of the achievements.

  upgrade-server-RESERV.js is an end-game script to keep your money above 100b whilst also upgrading your purchased servers.

  I would reccomend adding "run factions-toast.js; run myHNet.js; run go.js" to your autoexec scripts in Help -> Options -> System.
